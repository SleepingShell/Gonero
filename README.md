Go implementation of (parts of) the Monero protocol

Very early pre-alpha-don't-use-it-probably-wont-compile-anyways AKA POC

Keys and hash both have random scalar defined...fix that shiz

Cannot currently handle transactions >127 (derivation_to_scalar)

Need to add support for integrated addresses (currently only handles 95-char format)
